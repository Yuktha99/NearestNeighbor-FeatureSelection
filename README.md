The program performs a Feature selection with nearest neighbor algorithm.
Two feature selection techniques are implemented.
1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Elimination

The user will be able to provide the name of the ".txt" file that contains the dataset of features and their choice of algorithm. (Forward selection/Backward Elimination).
The program returns the most important features along with the stack trace of all the iterations including the feature subsets and accuries at each step.
